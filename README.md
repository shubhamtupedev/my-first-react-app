# Description
This project is a basic full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It serves as a foundational example of connecting a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend, demonstrating essential features such as REST API integration, state management, and basic authentication.

# Key Features
* React Frontend:
1) User-friendly UI with responsive design.
2) Integration with Axios for API requests.
3) State management using React hooks.
4) Forms for user input with validation (e.g., registration, login).

# Spring Boot Backend:
* RESTful API implementation.
1) Secure authentication and authorization with Spring Security.
2) Connection to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, H2) using JPA and Hibernate.
3) Data validation using Hibernate Validator.

# Technologies Used
* Frontend: React, Axios, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate
* Database: MySQL (or any other RDBMS)
* Build Tools: Maven (backend), npm (frontend)
